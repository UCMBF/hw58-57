        <h1>About</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Novak Djokovic is a Serbian professional tennis player. He is ranked world No. 1 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), has held the top ranking for 295 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 an Open Era record six times (equaling Pete Sampras). Djokovic has won 17 Grand Slam men's singles titles, the third-most in history behind only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. He is the only player to complete the career Golden Masters â€“ that is, winning all nine modern ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, which he has done twice. Overall, he has won 81 ATP singles titles, including a record eight Australian Open titles and a record 36 Masters events.
            <br>
            <br>
       <p>Djokovic had another career year in 2015, reaching fifteen consecutive finals, including all four major finals and eight Masters finals, winning three majors and six Masters events as well as the ATP Finals. The following year, he won the 2016 French Open to complete the career Grand Slam and become the first male player since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold four major titles at once. After long trailing both Federer and Nadal in their head-to-head records, Djokovic has since taken the lead against all of the other Big Four members. Representing Serbia, Djokovic has led the Serbia Davis Cup team to their first title in 2010, and also led Serbia to a title at the inaugural ATP Cup in 2020. He won a bronze medal in singles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
